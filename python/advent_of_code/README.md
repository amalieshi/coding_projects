 solving Advent of Code 2022
 
Advent of code 2022 is really great! I have bene honing up my python skills and practice Git here. I have been getting more comfortable in writing codes in PyCharm and VScode. 

Some of the lessons learnt here:
 - use Jupyter notebook for documentation, and don't use it as a primary environment to develop code. Always practice your debugging skills to be proficient in using different shortcuts.
 - PEP8 is your friend. Always make readability your priority. 
 - Branch early and branch often. Squash your commit messages during development to maka the tree clean.
 - seperate your raw data and the code to make it easy to read.
 - most importantly, practice makes you a better coder.
